# img420-assignment-2

In this project, I created a FadingSprite node, which extends Sprite2d and comes with custom fade in and fade out animations, configurable with rotation over time, scaling over time, and the ability to reverse the animation and fade directions using 2 booleans passed to the start_animation function.
